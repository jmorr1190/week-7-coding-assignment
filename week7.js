//*Create an array called ages that contains the following values: 3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93.

    //* a. Programmatically subtract the value of the first element in the array from the value in the last element of the array.
       //* - Do not use numbers to reference the last element, find it programmatically.
        //* - ages[7] - ages[0] is not allowed!
    //* b. Add a new age to your array and repeat the step above to ensure it is dynamic. (works for arrays of different lengths).
    //* c. Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the average age.

    let ages = (3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93) => ages(0)-(7); 
    console.log(ages(0,7));
